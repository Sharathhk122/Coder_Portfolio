# Deployment :rocket:

Deploying the app to platforms like Vercel or Netlify is quick and easy.

## Deploying to Vercel:

1. **Sign up or log in** to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Once logged in, click on **"New Project"**.
3. Select your **GitHub repo** (the one that contains your forked project) and click **Import**.
4. Configure your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard by adding each key from your `.env` file.
   - E.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.
5. Click on **Deploy**. Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js app and build it.
6. Once the deployment is complete, you can visit your live website!

### Updating After Deployment

Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repo, Vercel will automatically redeploy the app, keeping your portfolio up-to-date.

## Deploying to Netlify:

# Tutorials :wrench:

## Gmail App Password Setup

1. **Log in to your Google Account** at [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Security** from the left sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the **"Signing in to Google"** section and make sure **2-Step Verification** is turned ON.
4. Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, you'll see an option for **App Passwords**.
5. Click on **App Passwords**. You may need to enter your Google account password again.
6. In the **Select app** dropdown, choose "Mail", and for **Select device**, choose "Other (Custom name)" and name it appropriately (e.g., "Portfolio").
7. Click **Generate**. A 16-character app password will be displayed. Save this password for later use in your environment variables (e.g., `GMAIL_PASSKEY`).

## Create a Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** and search for the user **@BotFather**.
2. Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. Choose a name for your bot.
4. Set a unique username for your bot (must end with `bot`, e.g., `PortfolioAssistantBot`).
5. Once your bot is created, BotFather will send you a **Token**. Save this token, as you will need it for your environment variables (e.g., `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).
6. To get your chat ID:
   - Open your bot in Telegram and send it a message.
   - Visit the following URL in your browser, replacing `BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token:  
     `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Look for the `chat` object in the response, which contains your **chat ID** (you can use this value for `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`).

## Fetching Blog from dev.to

To display your blog posts from dev.to on the portfolio:

1. Set your `devUsername` in the `utils/data.js` file to your dev.to username.
2. The application will automatically fetch your latest blog posts and display them in the **BLOG** section.
3. Ensure your blogs are publicly visible on dev.to, and the application will fetch them using the dev.to API.

# FAQ:

1. For those facing the issue of "`next` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

Run the following command:

```bash

npm install -g next

```

This installs Next.js globally

then do the usual `npm run dev`
